#Functional testing

Tests features using [cucumber.js](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference/javascript).

It is recommended to launch these tests from within a Kuzzle docker container, to avoid the hassle of installing all the needed dependencies.

See the [Getting Started](../README.md) documentation for more information about installing Kuzzle.

## Running Functional Tests

    $ npm run functional-testing
