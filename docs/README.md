# Getting started

The main documentation to read before developing with Kuzzle is the [Api Specification](api-specification.md). You will find complete description of how talking to Kuzzle, a list with all entry points for REST API, the format of the message to be sent for all actions and the format of the object returned by Kuzzle.

For the filtering syntax overview, check the [Filters](filters.md) documentation.

# Advanced documentation (not required for a basic development)

For a deeper dive into Kuzzle  you can read the [Architecture](architecture.md) file.
You can also read the README.md file in each folders for a better understanding of various elements.
